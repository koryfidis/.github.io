# Georgios Koryfidis â€“ MSc Physics Student

Welcome to my GitHub page.

I am a master's student in Subatomic Physics & Technological Applications with a strong inclination to experimental particle physics and detector development.

My academic interests lie in subatomic and high-energy physics, and I enjoy working on hands-on research projects that combine instrumentation with computational analysis.

## About `muon.py`

This repository contains a script developed as part of a basic graduate-level project on novel trigger system simulation, for an introductory presentation in Experimental Data Analysis course.

The script, created in collaboration with my classmate Stylianos Kostakis, performs basic track reconstruction using Monte Carlo-generated events from an upper surface travelling downwards to the lower surface.

It includes basic data parsing, event visualization, and simple algorithms to identify cosmic muon trajectories and coincidence events.
